// Write a program that reads three nonzero integers and determines and prints
// whether theyâ€™re the sides of a right triangle.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	double s1, s2, s3;             // potential sides of triangle
	cout << "Enter lengths of 3 segments: ";
	cin >> s1 >> s2 >> s3;
	 // determine whether length of some side squared is equal sum of two others sides squared
	bool result = ((s1 * s1 == s2 * s2 + s3 * s3) or (s2 * s2 == s1 * s1 + s3 * s3) or 
							(s3 * s3 == s1 * s1 + s2 * s2));									
	if (result)
		cout << "This segments could represent sides of the right triangle!" << endl;
