/*
Describe in general how youâ€™d remove any continue statement from a loop in a 
program and replace it with some structured equivalent. Use the technique you
developed here to remove the continue statement from the program of Fig.5.14.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	for ( int count = 1; count <= 10; ++count ) // loop 10 times
	{

			cout << count << " ";

	cout << "\nSkip printing 5 without using continue" << endl;
